## Introduction

The Rock, Paper, Scissors game is a classic hand game that's been enjoyed by people of all ages. In this project, I've created a digital version of the game that allows users to play against the computer. By working on this project, I gained a better understanding of web development fundamentals and how to create interactive user interfaces.

## Features

- Player vs. Computer gameplay.
- Randomized computer choices.
- Clear display of game results.
- Reload game and start over

## Gameplay

The rules of the game are simple:

- Rock beats Scissors.
- Scissors beats Paper.
- Paper beats Rock.

  The player makes their choice by clicking on one of the three options. The computer's choice is generated randomly, and the winner of the round is determined according to the rules above.

## Technologies Used
