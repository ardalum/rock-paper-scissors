In our UI, the player should be able to play the game by clicking on buttons rather than typing their answer in a prompt.
For now, remove the logic that plays exactly five rounds.
Create three buttons, one for each selection. Add an event listener to the buttons that call your playRound function with the correct playerSelection every time a button is clicked. (you can keep the console.logs for this step)
Add a div for displaying results and change all of your console.logs into DOM methods.
Display the running score, and announce a winner of the game once one player reaches 5 points.
You will likely have to refactor (rework/rewrite) your original code to make it work for this. That’s OK! Reworking old code is an important part of a programmer’s life.

1. remove for loop

2. create 3 buttons for the player to select

3. create an event listener that will produce the value of the button that was clicked by the player everytime a button was clicked

4. add a div to display the result of each round of the game replace the console.log with the dom message

5. display running score for both the computer and the user

6. display a message of the result of the 5 round game

7. the game should end when computer or player reaches 5 points
